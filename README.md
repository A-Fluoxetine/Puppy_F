**Puppu-F Soothing quadruped robot**, named after *fluoxetine*, also known as ___Prozac___, is the most widely used antidepressant medication. In order to cope with the aging population in the future, with the initial idea of **"conducting research on home environment assisted devices for the daily life of the elderly"** and "even middle school students can easily understand and complete replicas", we tried to start from scratch and hand massage a robotic dog. The 3D model was initially borrowed from Pineapple Dog, using the main control Raspberry Pi 4B+ROS noetic+Ubuntu 20.04 os.

Puppu_F抚慰四足机器人，名字源于氟西汀，别名百忧解，是应用最广泛的抗抑郁药物。为了应对未来人口老龄化，抱着“中学生也能轻松理解完成复刻”和“展开居家环境对于老人日常生活辅助设备研究”的初想法，我们尝试从零开始手搓一条机器狗。3D模型最初借用了菠萝狗，使用主控树莓派4B+ros noetic+ubuntu20.04 os.如果你喜欢这个项目，也可以通过我的邮箱或者Bilibili账号找到我。
