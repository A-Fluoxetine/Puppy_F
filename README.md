# Puppy_F
**Puppu-F Soothing quadruped robot**, named after *fluoxetine*, also known as ___Prozac___, is the most widely used antidepressant medication. In order to cope with the aging population in the future, with the initial idea of **"conducting research on home environment assisted devices for the daily life of the elderly"** and "even middle school students can easily understand and complete replicas", we tried to start from scratch and hand massage a robotic dog. The 3D model was initially borrowed from Pineapple Dog, using the main control Raspberry Pi 4B+ROS noetic+Ubuntu 20.04 os.
